# Machine-Learning-Models
Machine Learning Models trained on `Toy Datasets` and `Real World Datasets` from **Scikit-learn**. 


## About the folders

Each of these folders contains the code notebook and saved models.




* **TD_classification** - Contains the *Classification* models trained on `Toy Datasets`.

* **RWD_classification** - Contains the *Classification* models trained on `Real World Datasets`.

* **TD_regression** - Contains the *Regression* models trained on `Toy Datasets`.
